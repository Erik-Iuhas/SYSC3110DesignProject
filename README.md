### Project Milestones

- [x] Milestone 1: Create a text-based playable game.
- [x] Milestone 2: Make game GUI based.
- [ ] Milestone 3: Implement AI players and many more features!
- [ ] Milestone 4: Save/load game and custom maps

### Milestone 1 Deliverables
1. Readme :white_check_mark:
2. Source code + jar executable :white_check_mark:
3. UML Diagram :white_check_mark:
4. Documentaion :white_check_mark:

The readme file is used to describe our project and the roadmap ahead.
The source code consists of classes that work work together to make our text based game playable.
The UML diagram displays how our classes interact with one another.
We documented all of our code and provided a Word Document describing our choice in data structures.

### Changes Made
**Milestone 1**<br>
There were many changes made to this iteration of the progejct. Our UML was revised several times, classes were created, deleted and refactored and many bugs were squashed. Our group also changed, we unfortuantely had a member drop the course resulting in the remaining members to absorb a little extra work. We were able to fix many bugs and after long hours in voice calls we created a playable textbased version of RISK. <br>
**Milestone 2**<br>
In Milestone 2, we had to update the entire game to be GUI based so we went out to achieve the best looking game of RISK ever made, with 3 playable character in the roster and more to come. This version of the game has an easy to use interface which allows for players to clearly know their owned territories and enemies with ease. Along with background music and a winning track, the game is bound to get Game of the Year.  

### Known Issues
There arent any currently known issues in our code.

### Project Roadmap
Milestone 3! In the third milestone we are going to create an AI mode that can determine which moves are best and play the game for us. We are looking forward to add AI so instead of playing the game ourselves, we can just sit back and relax to the world domination beats. Our current version in Milestone 2 also includes some of the Milestone 3 requirements such as continent/troop bonus, shout out to Ahmad for taking the lead on that one.
