The goal of this team project is to reproduce a simplified version of the classic strategy game RISK.

Group 3 is currently in the process of stucturing the game and making sure our classes work together. 
There are currently a lot of know issues as we are still trying to make the game playable.
We are all eager to work on this project and cant wait to get a working demo!

### Project Milestones

- [x] Milestone 1: Create a text-based playable game.
- [ ] Milestone 2: Make game GUI based.
- [ ] Milestone 3: Implement AI players and many more features!
- [ ] Milestone 4: Save/load game and custom maps

### Milestone 1 Deliverables
1. Read.me :white_check_mark:
2. Source code + jar executable :white_check_mark:
3. UML Diagram :white_check_mark:
4. Documentaion :white_check_mark:

The read.me file is used to describe our project and the roadmap ahead.
The source code consists of classes that work work together to make our text based game playable.
The UML diagram displays how our classes interact with one another.
We documented all of our code and provided a Word Document describing our choice in data structures.

### Changes Made
There were many changes made to this iteration of the progejct. Our UML was revised several times, classes were created, deleted and refactored and many bugs were squashed. Our group also changed, we unfortuantely had a member drop the course resulting in the remaining members to absorb a little extra work. We were able to fix many bugs and after long hours in voice calls we created a playable textbased version of RISK. 

### Known Issues
There is 1 known issue, we are assuming that the player will use all their avaliable troops in the reinforce stage.
Reinforce -1 gives player an extra troop


### Project Roadmap
Milestone 2! In the second milestone we are required to convert the game from text based to GUI based and implement Unit Testing. We are looking forward to 
adding GUI because it will make playing the game a lot more enjoyable. Adding unit testing will also help us save a lot of time because the testing will be automated instead of us constanly playing the game while testing for unexpected behaviour.
